                        <h3>GEMSBOK/h3>
                            <p>The gemsbok (Oryx gazella gazella) is the largest; it stands up to 138 cm (54 inches) tall and weighs 238 kg (524 pounds). It also has the most striking coloration: gray-brown with contrasting black and white body and facial markings. </p>
                            <p>The Arabian, or white, oryx (O. leucoryx) is the smallest, 102 cm (40 inches) tall and weighing 75 kg (165 pounds), with only faint dark markings to offset its whitish coat. The scimitar-horned oryx (O. dammah), 120 cm (47 inches) tall and weighing 200 kg (440 pounds), is mostly white except for the reddish brown neck and chest. The horns are long and straight in the gemsbok and the Arabian oryx.</p>
                            <p>Females’ horns are thinner but as long as those of males. The Arabian and scimitar-horned oryxes are listed as endangered species.</p>
                            <p>The three subspecies of O. gazella live in eastern and southern Africa: the beisa (O. gazella beisa) and fringe-eared oryx (O. gazella callotis) from the Horn of Africa south to Tanzania and the gemsbok in the Karoo region of South Africa. The scimitar-horned oryx, once found throughout northern Africa, was restricted to the southern rim of the Sahara (the Sahel) by the early 1980s and was virtually extinct in the wild by the century’s end. The Arabian oryx once lived in the deserts of the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas and adjacent areas to the north. The last survivors were captured in the early 1970s and bred in captivity. Efforts to reintroduce their descendents, beginning in Oman in 1982, have been partially successful but are dependent on effective protection from poaching.</p>
                    
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the Gemsbok at the North End of the zoo, just before the Panda Exibition.</p>
