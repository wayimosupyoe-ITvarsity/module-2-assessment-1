                            <p>This is a time to disconnect from screen time and reconnect with family.</p>
                            <p>Look up, look down, look in places your wouldnâ€™t usually. Exploring after your meal will get your kids excited about sharing all the things they find in their natural world with you. </p>
                            <p>Children will be able to hear, smell, see and feel things they may have not before. Imagine your child hearing cicadas and birds flying past their heads, smelling the rainforest, feeling ferns, moss and river rocks and seeing an array of wild animal in front of their eyes.</p>
                    
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND US</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find Lost Forest at North East, en route the North Gate</p>
