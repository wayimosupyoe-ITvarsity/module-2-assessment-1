                        <h3>WARTOG</h3>
                            <p>Warthog, (Phacochoerus aethiopicus), member of the pig family, Suidae (order Artiodactyla), found in open and lightly forested areas of Africa. The warthog is a sparsely haired, large-headed, blackish or brown animal standing about 76 centimetres (30 inches) at the shoulder. It has a coarse mane extending from the neck to the middle of the back, and it has a long, thin, tufted tail that it carries high while it is running.</p>
                            <p>The male has two pairs of bumps, or warts, on the face. Both sexes bear tusks; those of the lower jaw form sharp weapons, and those of the upper jaw curve upward and inward in a semicircle, attaining a length of more than 60 cm in some males.</p>
                            <p>The warthog is a gregarious animal that feeds on grass and other vegetation. It often shelters in enlarged aardvark burrows, which it enters backward so as to be able to defend itself.</p>
